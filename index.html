    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p>My name is Luke, I have a keen interest in becoming a web developer and in the future moving towards app development. I may be new to the programming scene but what I may lack in knowledge I make up for in a passion and drive to learn. My website is very basic as I just wanted to show I can use the basic tools to start off a website and this certaintly isn't the end project. I'm learning through a complete web develpment course on udemy. Even though I'm new to the scene I truly have an interest in programming, as someone who loves gaming and tech I have always respected the proccess in what goes into making the applications I use on a daily basis.</p>
